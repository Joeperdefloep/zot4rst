===========================
Zotero for reStructuredText
===========================
-----------------
Things left to do
-----------------

* In-text styles should be auto-detected, with any footnotes
  that consist entirely of zotero:: directives moved into the
  main text, and their footnotes quashed. Priority of the
  citation rendering passes might need to be adjusted, to
  catch notes in the correct state for this.

* rst2pdf doesn't work. As touchups will often be needed
  anyway, maybe rst2odf -> odf -> print to PDF is an acceptable
  processing chain?

* EasyInstall should maybe be hooked up, to get zotero.py,
  the processing scripts and the modified styles.odt (for
  small-caps support) onto the user's system with a minimum
  of fuss.

* Maybe the variant rst2xxx scripts should be given separate
  names, like zrst2xxx?

* With a bit more work (later) it should be possible to
  embed the JSON for cited items in a dump of the original
  source document, in a ReST comment block. We could then
  provide an option to process with the embedded data. There
  would be some details to work out (esp. where citeproc-js 
  would reside in that case), but it would give us a portable
  copy of the document, which would be very handy in
  production.
