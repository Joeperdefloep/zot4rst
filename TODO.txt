===========================
Zotero for reStructuredText
===========================
-----------------
Things left to do
-----------------

* In-text styles should be auto-detected, with any footnotes
  that consist entirely of zotero:: directives moved into the
  main text, and their footnotes quashed. Priority of the
  citation rendering passes might need to be adjusted, to
  catch notes in the correct state for this.

* rst2pdf doesn't work. As touchups will often be needed
  anyway, maybe rst2odf -> odf -> print to PDF is an acceptable
  processing chain?

* EasyInstall should maybe be hooked up, to get zotero.py,
  the processing scripts and the modified styles.odt (for
  small-caps support) onto the user's system with a minimum
  of fuss.

* Maybe the variant rst2xxx scripts should be given separate
  names, like zrst2xxx?
